In order to launch the program, it's ought to do the following steps:

1) Launch TinyRedisServer application from the folder of the same name. Options "-p" or "--port" for the choice of port and options "-m" or "--mode" for the choice of port can be used.

2) Launch TinyRedisClient application from the second folder. If you had chosen a port of your preferences in a previous step, don't forget to use it here as well.

Optionally you can launch multiple clients at the same time, though you would do it at your own risk.

Test data and adequate docker files unfortunately are not yet available.
